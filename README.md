# QA_RAG_demo

This notebook provides an introduction to genAI, leading up to a Question Answer Retrevial Augmented Generation (QA RAG) bot. The files in the PDF directory are ingested and provided as context.

You'll need to add your OpenAI API key to the .env file before running the notebook. 

Much thanks to [Patrick Debois's repo](https://github.com/jedi4ever/learning-llms-and-genai-for-dev-sec-ops) which inspired this notebook.
